Requirements:
1. Take the json from the custom form and prepare to post it to the server.
	 We can grab the data using {{form}} and send the data to the server.
2. Receive json from the server and rebuild the custom form.
	 We can pick prebuild forms by adding options to our static-data file. We can also alter the code to display data from JSON. The location to alter the code will vary dependign on where we want to display the form.
3. Prepare to style the form builder to our own specs.
	Depending on what we want, we can edit the views files to change how our app looks. We can also add new fields by adding templates for the fields.


Notes:
1. We can grab the data of our desired form by using:
{{ form }}.
We can probably use this to transmit data.

2. In \angularjs-form-builder\app\static-data, we created two sample forms. To force a certain form to display, there is a function that takes id as input in the following file:
\app\scripts\services\form-service
Forcing the id forces what form is displayed in sample forms. 
This function is called in

3. In \app\view\create.html we have:
div class="span4"><input type="text" name="form-id" ng-disabled="true" ng-model="form.form_id"></div>
Just change ng-disabled to false and we can change the form id in create form

4. In \app\scripts\controllers\create.js we define formID on the "Create a form" page. The controller is called in \app\scripts\app.js.
